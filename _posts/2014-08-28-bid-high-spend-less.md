Marketers struggle when they have to reach their goals at reasonable costs. It
is quite common that many advertisers merely look at CPC and CPM to try to keep
them as low as possible. In performance marketing, this may kill your
objectives. Here's why.

### Understanding bids
When you place an ad on Facebook, you are implicitly joining an auction. The
item your are auctioning for is a batch of one thousand **impressions** – in
other words, an advertising space on Facebook (either on News Feed, Right Hand
Side or the Facebook Ad Network). This auction is quite peculiar – you can bid
as much as you want but usually you will get charged less than your original
bid**. This ensures a fairer auction by allow everybody in the auction to bid
for their real objectives.

Here's a real-life example. Advertiser A and Advertiser B are two retailers and
they are promoting the same product on Facebook to the same audience, 30
years-old males interested in Shirts.

They are both bidding CPM. Advertiser A is willing to pay no more than $0.20
while Advertiser B is bidding more aggressively and is willing to pay no more
than $12.00. Who is the winner and how much it gets charger?

Advertiser B is the winner, but it gets charged much less than it originally
bidded for. Did you catch the drift? It's good to bid aggressively, but it's
better to bid your real value.

### Don't spend more – spend more efficiently
Bidding aggressively is a good strategy but it may lead to pacing, a condition
in which your campaign will deliver less towards its end. However, we optimise
our bidding strategy to reduce the effects of pacing, especially if you are
planning a campaign with low budget.

When you increase your bid, you can potentially **reach more people**. Why?
Because audiences on Facebook have their own bid segment. The underlying basic
principle is that you should pay more to reach people who ofter see or click an
ad, and you have to may more to get the attention of people who do not ofter
interact with an ad.

So, if you bid more, you can get to people who do not often click your ads, and
this may mean that you may get more conversions – and if you get more
conversions your ultimate Cost Per Action will go down.
