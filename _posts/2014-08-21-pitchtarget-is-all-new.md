### Hiding complexity
We are working hard to bring you a tool that does not need you to know how
Facebook Ads work. You just need to tell Pitchtarget what your objective is by
clicking **Products**, **Retarget** or **Mobile**.

Behind the scenes, we setup and optimise your campaign based on patterns that
work depending on your objectives.

### Products, not posts
If you own an ecommerce, you would be probably happy to hear that everything in
Pitchtarget is oriented to products. First, you create one or more of your
targets to clearly segment your audiences.

Next, you can select to promote an existing product from your Page Posts, or to
create a new Product unit. New on Facebook, you can use the new
**Multi-Product Unit** that allows you to promote three products at once, plus
it allows you to direct the user to your ecommerce.

### Straight-talking metrics
Ecommerces that run direct response objectives want to keep track of
conversions, not clicks. ROI and basket size are important, and that's why our
dashboards shows them so prominently.

At a glance you can see the progress of your campaigns and metrics such as ROAS
and average CPA. You can also have a look at trends and breakdowns by looking at
your Campaign Dashboard.

### What's next
This release only marks a preview of what is coming soon on Pitchtarget. In the
next few weeks, we will roll out new features that will bring automation to our
flows and that will automatically suggest you the right strategy for your
objective.
