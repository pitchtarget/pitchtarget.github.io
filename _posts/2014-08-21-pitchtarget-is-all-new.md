We are thrilled to announce that **Pitchtarget is available in public beta!**
Starting from today, you can sign up and start using our platform for your
performance marketing campaigns on Facebook.

### Hiding complexity
We are working hard to bring you a tool that does not need you to know how
Facebook Ads work. You just need to tell Pitchtarget what your objective is by
clicking **Products**, **Retarget** or **Mobile**.

Behind the scenes, we setup and optimise your campaign based on patterns that
work depending on your objectives.

### Products, not posts
