title: It's all about funnels

A person's purchase is just the final step of a longer journey. It usually
involves putting your brands in front of that person in the hope that he or she
will eventually consider your products and purchase something from you. This
process is widely known as the **purchase funnel** and it is one fundamental
truth of modern marketing.

In performance marketing, it is important to understand that there are other
types of funnels. Your website traffic and the amount of conversions are
strictly related – the more people enter into your website, the more chances you
have to obtain a purchase from them. What actions can you take to get more
conversions from your users?

### Think funnel
From your standpoint, the user journey from visit to purchase is quite a bumpy
road. There are a few but important bottlenecks that prevent your visitors to
buy what you are selling: **Traffic and Audience, Click-Through Rate and
Conversion Rate**.

#### 1. Traffic and Audience
The first bottleneck is your website traffic. Are your traffic volumes high
enough to make sure that you will get a critical mass of conversions? Before you
start a direct response campaign, you should have your audience size clear in
mind.

When you determine your audience size, you should make sure that your campaign
budget will be high enough to saturate or to cover the vast majority of that
audience. Our platform will do its best to optimise your budget to make sure
that you reach your audience more efficiently.

Your campaign budget is like fuel for your car – the more you have, the further
you'll go.

#### 2. Click-Through Rate
Now that you determined how many people do you expect to see in your website,
you should make sure that they actually visit it. When you prepare an ad, you
want to make sure that its image is appealing, and that the description invites
the user to take action and visit your website. Great creatives yield great
results, so make sure to make the most of your creative effort to make sure that
people on Facebook will visit your website.

But there's more. **CTR is also affected by targeting**. If you put the right ad
in front of the right people, they will be more interested in your products.
Remember, **Facebook's is up to 90% accurate in targeting audiences**, which
means that it is very easy for you to find all of the people that matters to
you.

#### 3. Conversion Rate
After your audience landed on your website, you should make sure that they will
have a nice experience. If you give your visitors an awesome user experience,
they will stay more on your ecommerce, and probably they will also shop more
often. There are plenty of books on the matter, but the underlying logic is
straightforward: do not overthink design, and give your users what they are
looking for. Always optimise your product pages. You should strive to reduce the
friction between an add to cart and a completed checkout.

Marketers usually look at retargeting options such as real time bidding to
improve their conversion rates, but this strategy is limited to desktop only and
cannot take into account your users' visits into your website.
