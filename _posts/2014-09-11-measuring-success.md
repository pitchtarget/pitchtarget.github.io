Many marketers new to Facebook struggle to understand how to leverage
measurement to understand how their campaigns are going. Here are a few things
you should know to determine the success of your strategies.

### Know your KPIs
First of all, you should make sure that you know what you want to measure, and
how these metrics affects your business. We've dealt with a number of marketers
that struggled to figure out what numbers they should look at, and how to
compare them with other media they were buying.

If you own an ecommerce and you aim to sell more products to more people, your
potential reach is as valuable as your ROAS. You should look to maximise the
number of people you are targeting without losing targeting precision.
**Lookalike Audiences** proved to be an extraordinary tool for these objectives.

### Know your data
You should also try to do some match around metrics you already know.
[As we explained in our previous post]({% post_url 2014-09-04-its-all-about-funnels %})
you should leverage your existing CTR and CR in order to work out how big your
target audience should be. There are many things you can do to improve your CTR
(you can try multiple creatives ad ad formats) and your CR (for instance by
finding easier ways to make your purchase process straightforward).

### Leverage your data
We often work with marketers to import their existing conversion data into
Facebook. This way, they can build audiences based on what people purchased or
added to their cart, so that we can expand those audiences to bring even more
conversions.

This strategy is also good if your goal is to lower your CPA, because you are
leverage your user's past intensions to build a precise audience of people with
a strong purchase intent.
